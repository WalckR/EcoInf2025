# This folder contains scripts for analyses and figures conducted in the manuscript "High-resolution mapping of peatland CO2 fluxes using drone multispectral images"


Manuscript reference: Walcker, R., Le Lay, C., Gandois, L., Elger, A., Jassey V. (in revision) High-resolution mapping of peatland CO2 fluxes using drone multispectral images. Ecological Informatics.

Analysis presented here have been performed using the Jupyter notebook programed in Python language.

!! Please note: this repository contains the scripts used to run the actual analysis presented in the manuscript. Since the time of publication, code aspects may have changed and thus some of these scripts could create errors that did not originally occur.
